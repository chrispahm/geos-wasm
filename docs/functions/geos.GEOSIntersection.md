<a name="exp_module_geos--geos.GEOSIntersection"></a>

## geos.GEOSIntersection ⇒ <code>number</code> ⏏
Computes a geometry that represents the point set intersection of the input geometries.

**Kind**: Exported member  
**Returns**: <code>number</code> - A pointer to the resulting geometry, or NULL if an exception was thrown.  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| g1 | <code>number</code> | A pointer to the first geometry. |
| g2 | <code>number</code> | A pointer to the second geometry. |
