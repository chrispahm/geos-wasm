## geos.GEOSSharedPaths ⇒ <code>number</code> ⏏
Computes a geometry representing the shared paths between two linear geometries.

**Kind**: Exported member  
**Returns**: <code>number</code> - A pointer to the geometry representing the shared paths between g1 and g2, or NULL on exception.  
**See**: [https://libgeos.org/doxygen/geos__c_8h.html](https://libgeos.org/doxygen/geos__c_8h.html)  

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| handle | <code>number</code> | A pointer to the GEOS context handle. |
| g1 | <code>number</code> | A pointer to the first geometry. Must be linear. |
| g2 | <code>number</code> | A pointer to the second geometry. Must be linear. |
